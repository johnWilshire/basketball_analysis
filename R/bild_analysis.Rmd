# This is the bild analysis of basketball 'streak' data

```{R}
library(bild)
```

```{R}
str(airpollution)
```

This is the structure of the example dataset.  Need to massage our data into this sort of thing.  Note that this doesn't have a time column, since it's not using that functionality of the underlying package.  We'll have to think about this for our data.

```{R}
air2r <- bild(wheeze~age+smoking, data=airpollution, trace=TRUE, 
              time="age", aggregate=smoking, dependence="MC2R")
```

That was an example model.  

```{R}
summary(air2r)
```

Plotting to check assumptions

```{R}
plot(air2r)
```
