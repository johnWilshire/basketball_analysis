load the dataset and bild library

```{R}
library(bild)
ball <- read.csv("data/basketball_shots_curry.csv", sep = "|")
```
Preparation 
remove duplicates rows

```{R}
ball <- unique(ball)

# change makes shot to numeric vector 1 = TRUE, 0 = FALSE
ball$makes_shot <- as.numeric(ball$makes_shot) - 1
# convert the time and dates to comfy POSIX 
ball$date <-  lapply(ball$date,toString)
ball$date <- strptime(ball$date,"%B %d, %Y")

# there is probably a better way to do this
# a player should not be able to have score events twice in a second so worrying about the 
# tenth of a second isnt really a good idea imho
ball$time <-  lapply(ball$time,toString)
ball$time <- strptime(ball$time,"%M:%S")
ball <- ball[with(ball, order(time, decreasing = TRUE)),]
ball <- ball[with(ball, order(date, quarter)),]

curry <- ball[ball$player.player_id == "curryst01",]

```
### Bild

### Model 1: 
we only have 1 id'd person only curry
only with him for now
```{R}
curry_3ptr_1 <- curry[curry$event_type == "3-pt",]
curry_3ptr_1$id <- 1
# create an age of the shots from the curry
curry_3ptr_1$shot_age <- 1:nrow(curry_3ptr_1)

bild_1_id <- bild(makes_shot ~ shot_age + quarter + score_diff + distance,
                  data = curry_3ptr_1,
                  trace = TRUE,
                  aggregate = "shot_age",
                  dependence = "MC1",
                  time = "shot_age")
summary(bild_1_id)
plot(bild_1_id, main="bild_model_1")
```
## Model 2: 
each game that curry has played in is given a different id
each shot in that "bucket" is given a different shot_age in ascending order

prep:
```{R}
curry_3ptr_2 <- curry[curry$event_type == "3-pt",]

# assign ids
curry_3ptr_2$id <- as.numeric(as.factor(curry_3ptr_2$game_id))
# assign shot ages
# this could be done without a for loop but i am not well versed enough in R / functional programming
curry_3ptr_2$shot_age <- 0
i <- 0
id <- 0
for (event_index in 1:nrow(curry_3ptr_2)){
  if (id != curry_3ptr_2$id[event_index]){
    id <- curry_3ptr_2$id[event_index]
    i <- 0
  } else {
    i <- i + 1 
  }
  curry_3ptr_2$shot_age[event_index] <- i
}

bild_2_id <- bild(makes_shot ~ shot_age + quarter + score_diff + distance,
                  data = curry_3ptr_2,
                  trace = TRUE,
                  aggregate = "shot_age",
                  dependence = "ind",
                  time = "shot_age")
summary(bild_2_id)
plot(bild_1_id, main="bild_model_1")
```
